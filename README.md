Tic Tac Toe, also known as "Noughts and Crosses," is a classic paper-and-pencil game that's enjoyed by people of all ages. It's a two-player, strategy-based game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a line of three of their own symbols, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game is typically played with two different symbols: "X" and "O." One player takes the "X" symbol, and the other takes the "O" symbol. Players take turns placing their symbols in empty squares on the grid until one player achieves a winning line of three symbols or until the grid is filled, resulting in a draw.

The simplicity of the rules makes Tic Tac Toe easy to understand and play, yet it offers an engaging challenge that involves strategic thinking and careful planning. Players must anticipate their opponent's moves while also plotting their own to either block their opponent's potential winning moves or create their own winning opportunities.

Tic Tac Toe is often used as a teaching tool for children to develop critical thinking skills and basic concepts of game theory. Its straightforward nature makes it a popular game to play in various settings, ranging from casual family gatherings to educational environments.

While the traditional paper-and-pencil version remains popular, Tic Tac Toe has also been adapted into various digital formats, such as smartphone apps and online games. These adaptations often feature different themes, graphics, and interactive features, enhancing the gaming experience while staying true to the core rules and objectives of the original game
